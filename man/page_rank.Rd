\title{The Page Rank algorithm}
\usage{
page_rank(
  graph,
  algo = c("prpack", "arpack", "power"),
  vids = V(graph),
  directed = TRUE,
  damping = 0.85,
  personalized = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  options = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph object.}

\item{algo}{Character scalar, which implementation to use to carry out the
calculation. The default is \code{"prpack"}, which uses the PRPACK library
(https://github.com/dgleich/prpack). This is a new implementation in igraph
version 0.7, and the suggested one, as it is the most stable and the fastest
for all but small graphs.  \code{"arpack"} uses the ARPACK library, the
default implementation from igraph version 0.5 until version 0.7.}

\item{vids}{The vertices of interest.}

\item{directed}{Logical, if true directed paths will be considered for
directed graphs. It is ignored for undirected graphs.}

\item{damping}{The damping factor (\sQuote{d} in the original paper).}

\item{personalized}{Optional vector giving a probability distribution to
calculate personalized PageRank. For personalized PageRank, the probability
of jumping to a node when abandoning the random walk is not uniform, but it
is given by this vector. The vector should contains an entry for each vertex
and it will be rescaled to sum up to one.}

\item{weights}{A numerical vector or \code{NULL}. This argument can be used
to give edge weights for calculating the weighted PageRank of vertices. If
this is \code{NULL} and the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute then
that is used. If \code{weights} is a numerical vector then it used, even if
the graph has a \code{weights} edge attribute. If this is \code{NA}, then no
edge weights are used (even if the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute.
This function interprets edge weights as connection strengths. In the
random surfer model, an edge with a larger weight is more likely to be
selected by the surfer.}

\item{options}{A named list, to override some ARPACK options. See
\code{\link{arpack}} for details. This argument is ignored if the PRPACK
implementation is used.}
}
\value{
A named list with entries: \item{vector}{A
numeric vector with the PageRank scores.} \item{value}{The eigenvalue
corresponding to the eigenvector with the page rank scores. It should be
always exactly one.} \item{options}{Some information about the underlying
ARPACK calculation. See \code{\link{arpack}} for details. This entry is
\code{NULL} if not the ARPACK implementation was used.}

\details{
For the explanation of the PageRank algorithm, see the following webpage:
\url{http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html}, or the following
reference:

Search Engine. Proceedings of the 7th World-Wide Web Conference, Brisbane,
Australia, April 1998.

The \code{page_rank} function uses ARPACK to perform the calculation, see
also \code{\link{arpack}}.

Please note that the PageRank of a given vertex depends on the PageRank of
all other vertices, so even if you want to calculate the PageRank for only
some of the vertices, all of them must be calculated. Requesting the
PageRank for only some of the vertices does not result in any performance
increase at all.

Since the calculation is an iterative process, the algorithm is stopped
after a given count of iterations or if the PageRank value differences
between iterations are less than a predefined value.
